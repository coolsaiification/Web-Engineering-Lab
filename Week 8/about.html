<ol class="highlight">
  <li>
    <h4>Children who read often and widely get better at it.</h4>
    After all, practice makes perfect in almost everything humans do, and reading in no different.
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Reading exercises our brain.</h4>
    Reading is a much more complex task for the human brain rather than watching TV, for example. Reading strengthens brains connections and builds NEW connections.
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Reading improves concentration.</h4>
    Children have to sit still and quietly so that they can focus on the story when they are reading. If the read often, they will develop the skill to do this for longer.
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Reading teaches children about the world around them.</h4>
    Through reading a variety of books children learn about people, places, and events outside of their own experience.
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Reading improves vocabulary and language skills.</h4>
    Children learn new words as they read. Subconsciously, they absorb information on how to structure sentences and how to use words and other language features effectively in their writing and speaking.
